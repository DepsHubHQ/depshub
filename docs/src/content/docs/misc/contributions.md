DepsHub is an open-source project and we welcome contributions from the community. We have a few guidelines that we ask contributors to follow to ensure that the process is as smooth as possible.

## How to contribute

First, check the list of open issues on the [DepsHub GitHub repository](https://github.com/depshubhq/depshub) and make sure that the issue you want to work on is not already being worked on by someone else.
If you find an issue that you would like to work on, please comment on the issue to let others know that you are working on it.
