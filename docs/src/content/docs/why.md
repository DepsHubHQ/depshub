title: Why?

Managing dependencies is hard. DepsHub allows you to make **explicit** and **aware** decisions about your dependencies, rather than letting them accumulate over time.

- Automates a broad range of dependency management checks (consistency, security, licenses, etc.).
- Reduces the amount of PRs related to dependencies by updating only when _necessary_.
- Allows you to enforce your own policies through custom rules.
- Works with multiple languages and package managers.

## DepsHub vs. Other Tools

Most of the existing dependency management tools focus on a _single_ aspect of the problem - updating packages to the latest versions due to security vulnerabilities or outdated dependencies.

There are many more points to dependency management, such as consistency, licenses, maintainability, and more.

> There is no need to keep everything constantly updated to the latest version. DepsHub helps you to make _informed_ decisions about your dependencies.
