title: What is DepsHub?
---

**DepsHub** is a single-binary open source dependency management tool that helps to keep your dependencies tidy.

It scans all the dependencies in your project, finds inconsistent versions, unused dependencies, unmaintained packages, security vulnerabilities, etc., and helps you fix and prevent them.

It's designed to be used both locally and in CI/CD pipelines, supporting [multiple](/misc/supported) languages and package managers.

The source code is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/depshubhq/depshub).

## Features

- **Advanced linting rules** - checks for 20+ common [issues](/reference/rules) in your dependencies.
- **Comprehensive data sourcing** - package registries data, licenses information, security vulnerabilities and more.
- **Interactive** - update your dependencies with a single command.
- **Configurable** - customize the default behavior with a [configuration](/reference/configuration-file) file.
- **Extensible** - create [custom](/guides/custom) rules to enforce your own policies.
- **CI/CD ready** - integrates with your [CI/CD](/guides/integrations) pipelines.


## Why?
Managing dependencies is hard. DepsHub allows you to make **explicit** and **aware** decisions about your dependencies, rather than letting them accumulate over time.

- Automates a broad range of dependency management checks (consistency, security, licenses, etc.).
- Reduces the amount of PRs related to dependencies by updating only when _necessary_.
- Allows you to enforce your own policies through custom rules.
- Works with multiple languages and package managers.

## DepsHub vs. Other Tools

Most of the existing dependency management tools focus on a _single_ aspect of the problem - updating packages to the latest versions due to security vulnerabilities or outdated dependencies.

There are many more points to dependency management, such as consistency, licenses, maintainability, and more.

> There is no need to keep everything constantly updated to the latest version. DepsHub helps you to make _informed_ decisions about your dependencies.
