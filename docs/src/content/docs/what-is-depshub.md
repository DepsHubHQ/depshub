title: What is DepsHub?
---

**DepsHub** is a dependency management tool that helps to keep your dependencies consistent, secure, and up-to-date.
It's designed to be used both locally and in CI/CD pipelines, supporting [multiple](/misc/supported) languages and package managers.


## Features

- [**Linter**](/guides/linter) - checks for common issues in your dependencies.
- [**Updater**](/guides/updater) - updates your dependencies to the latest versions.
- [**Configurable**](/reference/configuration-file) - customize the default behavior with a configuration file.
- [**Custom rules**](/guides/custom) - create custom rules to enforce your own policies.
- [**CI/CD**](/guides/integrations) - integrates with your CI/CD pipelines.
- **Security** - checks for vulnerabilities in your dependencies.
- **Automation** - automates dependency management tasks.
- **Local** - works locally on your machine.


## Why DepsHub?

For many developers, managing dependencies can be a tedious and time-consuming task.
DepsHub aims to simplify this process by providing a set of tools that automate common dependency management tasks.

While there are other tools available for dependency management, one of the main advantages of DepsHub is its simplicity, ease of use and high level of [customization](/reference/configuration-file/).

## DepsHub vs. Other Tools

Most of the existing dependency management tools focus on a single aspect of the problem - updating packages to the latest versions.
There are many more aspects to dependency management, such as security, consistency, and automation, which are often overlooked.

It works in as a CLI tool, making it easy to [integrate](/guides/integrations) into your existing workflows.
