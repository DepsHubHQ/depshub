title: What is DepsHub?
---

**DepsHub** is a dependency management tool that helps to keep your dependencies consistent, secure, and up-to-date.

It allows you to validate, lint, and update your dependencies, as well as enforce your own policies through custom rules.
It's designed to be used both locally and in CI/CD pipelines, supporting [multiple](/misc/supported) languages and package managers.


## Features

- **Comprehensive** - multiple data sources: packages data, licenses, security vulnerabilities and more.
- **Linter** - checks for 20+ common [issues](/reference/rules) in your dependencies.
- **Updater** - updates your dependencies to the latest versions when necessary.
- **Configurable** - customize the default behavior with a [configuration](/reference/configuration-file) file.
- **Supports custom rules** - create [custom](/guides/custom) rules to enforce your own policies.
- **CI/CD** - integrates with your [CI/CD](/guides/integrations) pipelines.


## Why DepsHub?

- Consistent dependencies across your projects.
- Reduces the time spent on dependency management by automating common tasks.
- Reduces the amount of PRs related to dependencies by updating only when _necessary_.
- Automates common dependency management checks (security, licenses, etc.).
- Allows you to enforce your own policies through custom rules.
- Works with multiple languages and package managers.

While there are other tools available for dependency management, one of the main advantages of DepsHub is its simplicity, ease of use and high level of [customization](/reference/configuration-file/).

## DepsHub vs. Other Tools

Most of the existing dependency management tools focus on a _single_ aspect of the problem - updating packages to the latest versions due to security vulnerabilities or outdated dependencies.

There are many more points to dependency management, such as consistency, licenses, maintainability, and more.

It works in as a CLI tool, making it easy to [integrate](/guides/integrations) into your existing workflows.
