title: What is DepsHub?
---

**DepsHub** is a dependency management tool that helps to keep your dependencies tidy.

It scans all the dependencies in your project, finds the most common mistakes, such as inconsistent versions, unused dependencies, security vulnerabilities, etc., and helps you fix them.

> DepsHub allows you to make **explicit** and **aware** decisions about your dependencies, rather than letting them accumulate over time.

It's designed to be used both locally and in CI/CD pipelines, supporting [multiple](/misc/supported) languages and package managers.

## Features

- **Comprehensive data sources** - multiple data sources: packages data, licenses information, security vulnerabilities and more.
- **Advanced linting rules** - checks for 20+ common [issues](/reference/rules) in your dependencies.
- **Interactive** - helps you to update your dependencies with a single command.
- **Configurable** - customize the default behavior with a [configuration](/reference/configuration-file) file.
- **Extensible** - create [custom](/guides/custom) rules to enforce your own policies.
- **CI/CD ready** - integrates with your [CI/CD](/guides/integrations) pipelines.


## Why DepsHub?

- Automates common dependency management checks (consistency, security, licenses, etc.).
- Reduces the time spent on dependency updates by automating common tasks.
- Reduces the amount of PRs related to dependencies by updating only when _necessary_.
- Allows you to enforce your own policies through custom rules.
- Works with multiple languages and package managers.

While there are other tools available for dependency management, one of the main advantages of DepsHub is its simplicity, ease of use and high level of [customization](/reference/configuration-file/).

## DepsHub vs. Other Tools

Most of the existing dependency management tools focus on a _single_ aspect of the problem - updating packages to the latest versions due to security vulnerabilities or outdated dependencies.

There are many more points to dependency management, such as consistency, licenses, maintainability, and more.

It works in as a CLI tool, making it easy to [integrate](/guides/integrations) into your existing workflows.
